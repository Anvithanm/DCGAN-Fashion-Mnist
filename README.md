# DCGAN-Fashion-Mnist
This project successfully demonstrates how a Deep Convolutional GAN can generate fashion images by learning the distribution of the Fashion-MNIST dataset. Through adversarial learning, the generator becomes increasingly capable of creating realistic and diverse images of clothing.
